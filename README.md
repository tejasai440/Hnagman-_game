HANGMAN GAME:

This is a simple hangman game with an old-school terminal theme.
It was written in Python, without any libraries or APIs . 
To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. 
If you guess incorrectly 6 times, you lose. 
If you guess the word before that happens, you win.
After you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing enter on the keyboard.
